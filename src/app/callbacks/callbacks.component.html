    <h1>What is a callback function?</h1>
    <blockquote>
        A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer
        function to complete some kind of routine or action.

        Callbacks are often used to continue code execution after an asynchronous operation has completed â€” these are called
        asynchronous callbacks. A good example is the callback functions executed inside a .then() block chained onto the end of
        a promise after that promise fulfills or rejects.
