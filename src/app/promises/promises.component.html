    <h1>What is a Promise?</h1>
    
    <blockquote>
        A promise is an object that may produce a single value some time in the future: either a resolved value, or a reason
        that itâ€™s not resolved (e.g., a network error occurred). A promise may be in one of 3 possible states: fulfilled,
        rejected, or pending. Promise users can attach callbacks to handle the fulfilled value or the reason for rejection.
        Promises are eager, meaning that a promise will start doing whatever task you give it as soon as the promise
        constructor
        is invoked. If you need lazy, check out observables or tasks.
